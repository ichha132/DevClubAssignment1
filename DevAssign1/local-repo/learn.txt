DevClub is one of the most interesting and fun clubs of IIT Delhi. I think it provides a platform where students learn about the new and upcoming technologies. This club improves coding skills of a student and encourages logical thinking. It teaches a student how technology is meant to make life easier and how we can use our coding skills to do something productive and contribute in making our nation better.
